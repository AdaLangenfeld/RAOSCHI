--------------------------
* Review of Achievements *
--------------------------

Livio:
- Further familiarization
- Check source code of machine-readable file shantou2017_3_1.pdf
  > The file only consists of encoded streams, thus we cannot use the PDF source file as additional information.
- Check code of TableBank paper in Detail.

Johannes:
- Send sample auxiliary file to Livio

--------------------------
* Current Status         *
--------------------------

* Currently active tasks
Livio:
- Build first proof of concept for bounding boxes
Excel to PDF + auxiliary file (JSON), where auxiliary file contains cell location, content and their position in the table.
  > Implement tool in python
  > Recognition algorithm for identifying tables / headers etc.
    > Currently it is manually implemented, as some inputs are missing, 
      Livio already created possible concepts and thought about pro's and con's of these concepts.

* Encountered problems, questions, difficulties, etc.
- A table needs the data to be in the same row, such that it can reliably 
- Recognition algorithm
  > On what information should we rely? Should we use Formatting, or only the tabular structure of the sheet?
    > Use Formatting when possible, might want to use deExecleration framework. (Starting point)
    > Clearly a new sheet creates a new table, the rest is to discuss
- Bounding box - how is the bounding box exactly represented in the JSON file? (left_x, left_y, right_x, right_y) position on page?
- JSON file structure
  > What is the use of "unk" and "meta" object, what should be put into these objects?
  > Are page_number objects needed? As far as Livio sees it, they won't be necessary for the Excel generated documents.

* Agenda                 *
--------------------------

- Build first proof of concept for bounding boxes
Excel to PDF + auxiliary file (JSON), where auxiliary file contains cell location, content and their position in the table.
  > Implement tool in python
  > Implement recognition algorithm for identifying tables / headers etc.

> DeExcelarator (Getting segmentation of excel files into table regions)

--------------------------
* ToDos                  *
--------------------------

Livio:
- Setup Thesis template: Google for existing MT and use it as template.
- Build first proof of concept for bounding boxes
- TableBank: Send Problems with code of TableBank to Slack, such that these can be fixed as soon as possible.
