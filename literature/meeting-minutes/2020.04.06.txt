- Git repo for code and thesis
https://github.com/DS3Lab/DocParser

- Is there a full Template of a systems group master thesis?
Google for existing MT and use it as a template.

- Structure of test-data
If PDFs are missing, they probably do not exist. Look at summary of data.

- The non-machine readable PDF files contain in their source code only encoded image data, thus it is not possible to extract any data from source code.

- Is there a machine readable PDF in the first test-data?
Check shantou2017_3_1.pdf

- If there are some interesting papers, please send them to me to get deepeer into the topic and gain knowledge of similar work.

- Code base of DocParser
Is not needed for the first tasks, Johannes will upload it as soon as needed.

- Structure of auxiliary file
Should be in JSON format, check linked master thesis and PDF Miner for examples. Johannes will additionally send a sample to Livio.
