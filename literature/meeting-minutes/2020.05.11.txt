* Review of Achievements *
--------------------------

Livio:
- Build first proof of concept for bounding boxes
  > Implemented creation of auxiliary file and extraction of bounding boxes. (See sample files)

--------------------------
* Current Status         *
--------------------------

* Currently active tasks
Livio:
- Build first proof of concept for bounding boxes
Excel to PDF + auxiliary file (JSON), where auxiliary file contains cell location, content and their position in the table.
  > Implement tool in python
  > DeExcelarator (Getting segmentation of excel files into table regions)

* Encountered problems, questions, difficulties, etc.
- What should we do with content which is larger than the cell size? In that case the bounding box
  > Color text as well to get the bounding box. (Either size of cell or length of text)
    > win32 has problems with that much font colors, not sure how to be able to solve this.
- How do we need to define the content of a page?
  > Page property to box.
- What should happen if a cell ranges over two or more pages?
  > Create a new bounding box for the new page.

--------------------------

Livio:
- Setup Thesis template: Google for existing MT and use it as template.
- Check actual error code of win10 fonts
- JSON file:
  > Add row and col range (change it in property and add additionaly key row and col range)
  > Create second bounding box for cells which range over more than one page
  > Add page property box element.
  > Change format of bounding box: [x, y, width, height]
- Check performance per Document, find throttling parts of the code. (10s per Document would be perfect)
- Save unedited PDF (generated from Excel file)
- Recognizing table structure - DeExcelerator
